# why?
Ever need to convert a file online but had that small voice in your head saying "what if they copy or see my file?" 
that is what this program if for, deeply mistrusting people. 
If for whatever reason you don't trust the GUI code, there is a minimalistic terminal based version

_it's also a repurpose for the backend of another project_
